This project performs sentiment analysis on reviews of IMDb movies to determine if they are positive or negative. It utilizes machine learning models to predict the sentiment and display the probability of each sentiment, providing insights into the audience's reaction to the movies. Data preprocessing steps include cleaning and tokenizing the reviews, followed by feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF. The model is trained and evaluated on a labeled dataset sourced from IMDb, and the results are visualized to show the overall sentiment distribution, individual review probabilities, and display corresponding happy or sad images based on the predicted sentiment and its probability.
